# Particles
Particles from Doug James's Physics Based Computer Graphics.

The code base from from Dr. Doug James's course at Cornell. I used the code base and make a simulator for computational mechanics when linkages are constrained. Constrained links are the same as infinite stiffness properties. 

This application was further used for my Masters of Engineering project and converted to an Applet to be used by Dr. Sachin Goyal for STEM teaching purposes.
